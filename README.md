# Dbilia Token - A Simple Custom Non Fungible Token

## Assignment

In this project you will be using either truffle or hardhat to build a small minting smart contract.
We recommend you to use the solidity version ^0.8.0;

Dbilia app accepts payment both in USD and ETH for minting; and smart contract needs to track this information.

- When a user wants to pay in USD, user pays gas fee to Dbilia in advance; and Dbiliaâ€™s ethereum account will mint the token on the userâ€™s behalf and will keep the token.
- When a user wants to pay in ETH, user himself (msg.sender) will mint and keep the token.

Create two minting functions in DbiliaToken.sol and make sure to emit an event.

- mintWithUSD()
  i. when we confirm the user has paid gas fee to Dbilia, we will trigger this function
  ii. Only Dbilia can trigger using a modifier
  iii. take four parameters (userId, cardId, edition, tokenURI)
  iv. add any require statements as much as possible
  v. create a mapping to track the owner of token using userId (because dbilia is minting on their behalf)
  vi. cardId and edition should be mapped to a mapping
  vii. mint
  viii. set token uri

- mintWithETH()
  i. take three parameters (cardId, edition, tokenURI)
  ii. add any require statements as much as possible
  iii. cardId and edition should be mapped to a mapping
  iv. mint
  v. set token uri

Make sure you create a test script and test all this process thoroughly.

Compiling your contracts...
===========================

  Contract: DbiliaToken
    mintWithUSD
      âˆš should be called by only owner (1142ms)
      âˆš should not mint for invalid user (188ms)
      âˆš should mint (293ms)
      âˆš should not be able to mint with same card (815ms)
    mintWithETH
      âˆš should require sufficient ETH (196ms)
      âˆš should mint (356ms)
      âˆš should not be able to mint with same card (1132ms)
